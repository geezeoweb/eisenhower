    <h1>Eisenhower</h1>
    <p>
        Eisenhower is a work-in-progress read-only rubygem to help you work the <a href="http://developers.interstateapp.com/">Interstate API</a>.
    </p>
    
    <ul class="examples">
        <li>
            {% highlight ruby %}Eisenhower.oauth_token = '432n4u3h24v23'{% endhighlight %}
            <p>
                First thing to do is set an OAuth token â€“&nbsp;how you get this, at the moment, is up to you.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            {% highlight ruby %}Eisenhower::Roadmap.all{% endhighlight %}
            <p>
                Now you can get all your roadmaps!
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            {% highlight ruby %}map = Eisenhower::Roadmap.all.first
map = Eisenhower::Roadmap.find('234f23f23fc2fg')
map.roads
{% endhighlight %}
            <p>
                You'll get back interconnected <strong>Eisenhower</strong> objects whenever possible. The main objects currently implemented, with closely-matching attributes, are:
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="http://developers.interstateapp.com/roadmap/get">Roadmaps</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://developers.interstateapp.com/road/get">Roads</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://developers.interstateapp.com/update/get">Road Updates</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://developers.interstateapp.com/staff/get">Staff</a></li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

                <h4>Refactor</h4>
                <p>
                    There are too many API calls, which makes getting simple information slow. API calls inside API calls gets ugly, and there's a lot of information that could be instantiated without an extra call.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Tests</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm as designer, and am subsequently despicable at writing tests. Please help.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Implement newer API objects</h4>
                <p>
                    There are now at least two more objects (File &amp; Activity) that I haven't touched yet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Writing as well as Reading</h4>
                <p>
                    The only reason Eisenhower is read-only is because that's all I've found time to do so far. Help here would be swell.
